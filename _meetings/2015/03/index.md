# March 2015

#### March 17, 2015
6:00 - 7:30 PM

###Topic

####Your code has tests and so should your infrastructure

This workshop will be hands on introduction to using rspec and serverspec (Ruby testing tools) to automate your infrastructure tests. We will test both "normal" servers/virtual-machines and Docker containers. This talk will translate well to any virtualization platform such as vmware, virtualbox and AWS.

I like to think there are two basic styles of infrastructure tests. First, "unit tests" are testing that certain packages are installed, configured, and are enabled properly. The second are "integration tests" such as ensuring your service is accepting connections on certain ports or two services are configured and can communicate properly such as web app and a database. We will cover both scenarios.

Depending on time, we will then cover tools that will facilitate running both of these styles of tests at a larger scale.

We will have Ubuntu virtual machines provided by to use during the workshop. So bring a laptop, a ssh client and a lightweight editor (vim, nano, emacs) and discussion topics. Ruby and linux knowledge is a plus, but are not specifically required, we will go as slow as we need.
