It's easy to build a server side API in one application and then consume that API via JS from that application.

It's tricky consuming that API from JS in another application because of the [Same-origin policy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same-origin_policy) implemented by all browsers.

It's even trickier to test that this is working. Kris will present a slick way to handle this by creating a mock application running on a different port than your application and then injecting that port into your JS.
