###Topic

####Ruby Koans - Continued
We are going to continue the idea we had last month and see if we can IMPROVE the Ruby Koans.

It appears the project has been neglected, so let's change that and see what we can get done!

###Food
Please note.  After the presentation, we will meet at Americana immediately after.  Hope to see you there!
