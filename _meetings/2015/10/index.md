# October 2015

#### October 20, 2015
6:00 - 7:30 PM

### Topic

#### Using Google Apps from Ruby

### Speakers

#### Julie Kent / [College Recruit U, LLC](https://www.collegerecruitu.com/)

#### David W. Body / [Big Creek Software, LLC](https://www.bigcreek.com/)

We recently developed [College Recruit U](https://www.collegerecruitu.com/) which is designed to help high school students with choosing a college by making the process fun, easy, and social.

After a demo of the application (developed with Ruby on Rails), we'll look at the admin interface which consists solely (for now) of a Google Docs spreadsheet and image files stored in Google Docs. We'll show you how we did this using [Google APIs](https://developers.google.com/google-apps/) and discuss the pros and cons.

We'll also talk about other potential use cases for interacting with Google Docs from Ruby (or other languages), including:

* User acceptance tests specified in Google spreadsheets
* Reports generated directly to Google Docs
