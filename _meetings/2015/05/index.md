###Topic

####Ruby Koans
Never heard of Ruby Koans?  Never finished them? Done them more than once?  It doesn't matter.

Let's have a Ruby basics workshop with the Ruby Koans.  Bring a laptop.

Go ahead and get started with them here:  https://github.com/neo/ruby_koans.

Confused?  That's OK!  Just bring a laptop and we'll help.

###Food
Please note.  After the presentation, we will meet at Americana immediately after.  Hope to see you there!
