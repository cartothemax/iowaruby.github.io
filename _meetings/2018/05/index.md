### Topic

#### Introduction to the R Language and Ecosystem

This talk will introduce you to [R](https://www.r-project.org/ ), a general purpose programming language and software environment that is popular for data analysis and visualization. We will introduce the R language, focusing on examples of the kinds of things that R excels at like data wrangling, exploratory data analysis, statistical computing, machine learning, and data visualization.

We'll also introduce the R ecosystem, including the [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/ ), an opinionated collection of R packages designed to make data science fast, fluent, and fun. We'll see examples of how you can create documents containing code and graphics using tools like [R Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/ ), as well as creating and publishing interactive data-driven web applications using [Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/ ).

No prior knowledge of R is required. The emphasis will be on breadth rather than depth. You'll come away with a basic understanding of what R is all about and suggestions for how to learn more.
