### Topic

#### System Automation and Orchestration

We all have something we'd like help orchestrating right? Maybe it's
application deployment, or maybe it's system updates, but no matter
what it is you'll need a set of tools to help you get there. Let's talk
about some of those tools, and how we can leverage them to fit whatever
our needs are. We'll talk about how you can use MCollective with a few
custom plugins and scripts to orchestrate your every day tasks, and some
tools you can use to manage adhoc tasks across environments in
repeatable, and reliable ways.
