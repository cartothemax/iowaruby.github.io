<h1>September 2011</h1>
<h4>September 20, 2011</h4>
<p>6:00 - 7:30 PM</p>
<h3>Speaker</h3>
<h4>Jacob Richardson / <a href="http://www.imtins.com/" rel="external">IMT Group</a></h4>
<h3>Topic</h3>
<h4>Enumerable</h4>
<p>We go back to basics this month and look at Ruby collections and the Enumerable module. Rubyists learn early on that as long as a class provides an 'each' method (and optionally a &lt;=&gt; comparison operator), simply mixing in the Enumerable module will automatically give the class all kinds of collection functionality including traversal, searching, sorting, etc.</p>
<p>Jacob will discuss the Enumerable module and also discuss</p>
<ul>
  <li>Increasing the readability of your code by reducing null checks and loops</li>
  <li>Functional thinking applied with Enumerable</li>
  <li>Extending Enumerable</li>
</ul>
<p>Jacob currently works as a Python developer for IMT Group, but not for long. He has accepted a job as a Rails developer at <a href="http://www.groupon.com/" rel="external">GroupOn</a> in Chicago and will be moving there soon. Earlier this year, Jacob was <a href="http://blog.obiefernandez.com/content/2011/01/rails-up-and-comers-contest-winners.html" rel="external">recognized</a> as a Rails Up-and-Comer by Obie Fernadez. This will be Jacob's last Iowa Ruby Brigade meeting for a while, so please come out to wish him well.</p>
