<h1>February 2011</h1>
<h4>February 15, 2011</h4>
<p>6:00 - 7:30 PM</p>
<h3>Speaker</h3>
<h4>Darrin Holst / <a href="http://www.geolearning.com/" rel="external" title="GeoLearning">SumTotal</a></h4>
<h3>Topic</h3>
<h4>MiniTest</h4>
<p>One of the core values of Ruby culture is testing. Testing is so
  important to the Ruby community that we have multiple test
  frameworks such as Test::Unit, RSpec, Shoulda, Cucumber, Steak,
  etc. (Not to mention all the test double and mocking/stubbing
  libraries to go along with these.)</p>
<p>For several years, Test::Unit was part of the standard Ruby
  library. Beginning with Ruby 1.9, Test::Unit has been replaced
  with the new, lighter weight MiniTest, which was designed to be a
  partial drop-in replacement for Test::Unit.</p>
<p>Darrin will introduce MiniTest and will compare and contrast it
  with Test::Unit and other test frameworks. And he'll show us some
  examples of MiniTest in action.</p>
