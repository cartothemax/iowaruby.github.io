<h1>August 2011</h1>
<h4>August 16, 2011</h4>
<p>6:00 - 7:30 PM</p>
<h3>General Discussion / Lightning Talks</h3>
<p>We don't have a specific presentation this month, but we'll still meet and discuss current developments in the Ruby world.</p>
<p>If you have something you'd like to share with the group, but you don't want to prepare a full presentation, please consider giving a "lightning talk" instead. A lightning talk is an short (5-10 minutes), informal talk / demo. Lightning talks can be on any topic of interest to the group, even if it's not directly Ruby-related.</p>
<p>Stuck on a Ruby problem? Bring your questions and get some help from local experts.</p>
<p>Please join us!</p>
