<h1>March 2011</h1>
<h4>March 15, 2011</h4>
<p>6:00 - 7:30 PM</p>
<h3>Topic</h3>
<h4>Working Effectively with Third-Party Web Services</h4>
<h3>Speaker</h3>
<h4>David W. Body / <a href="http://www.bigcreek.com.com/" rel="external">Big Creek Software, LLC</a></h4>
<p>David has been developing a Rails application whose core functionality involves interacting with a third-party commercial ASP.NET XML web service. The main interaction involves posting an XML request to the web service, and then asynchronously receiving XML results which may come hours or days later. The web service is production-only, involves sensitive data, and there is no separate test environment.</p>
<p>David will demo the application and then we'll dive into the source code.</p>
<p>Topics will include</p>
<ul>
  <li>Development, testing, and deployment strategies</li>
  <li>Simulating a web service with Sinatra</li>
  <li>Dealing with XML documents whose elements may not all be known in advance</li>
</ul>
<p>This Rails application is under active development, and David would welcome suggestions for changes and improvements.</p>
<p>There will be plenty of time for discussion and questions.</p>
