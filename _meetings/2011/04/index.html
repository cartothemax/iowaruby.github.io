<h1>April 2011</h1>
<h4>April 19, 2011</h4>
<p>6:00 - 7:30 PM</p>
<h3>Topic</h3>
<h4>ActiveModel</h4>
<p>One of the big themes of Rails 3 was making the entire Rails framework more modular. A perfect example of this is ActiveModel which is actually a group of modules extracted from ActiveRecord. ActiveModel provides an API through which Rails interacts with models, so any ORM that implements the ActiveModel API will automatically work with Rails. ActiveModel also exposes a lot of useful functionality like validation, callbacks, serialization (to_xml, to_json, etc), and i18n support.</p>
<p>We'll take a look at ActiveModel and see how it can be used to provide this kind of functionality to ordinary Ruby objects independently of whether they are persisted in a SQL database.</p>
<p>This topic should appeal to Rubyists of all experience levels. For beginners, we'll cover the basics of Ruby modules. Then we'll move on to intermediate topics like how to use ActiveModel outside of a Rails project and how to verify whether a Ruby object is AciveModel-compliant. We'll also spend a little time looking at how ActiveModel is actually implemented.</p>
<p>There will be plenty of time for discussion and questions.</p>
