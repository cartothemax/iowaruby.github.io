<h3>Topic</h3>
<h4>Procs &amp; Lambdas: Y U So Weird?</h4>
<p>Some languages provide first-class function features -- that is, a way
  of taking some bit of functionality in your program and treating it
  like a data value. Ruby gives you a few different ways. You can get a
  long way with blocks alone, but when it comes to Procs and their close
  cousins lambdas, there are some confusing and seemingly arbitrary
  differences in how they work. In this discussion, we will attempt to
  make sense of these and differences and why they might exist.</p>
