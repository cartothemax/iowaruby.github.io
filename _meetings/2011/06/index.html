<h1>June 2011</h1>
<h4>June 21, 2011</h4>
<p>6:00 - 7:30 PM</p>
<h3>Topic</h3>
<h4>Testing Fundamentals</h4>
<p>This month we continue our focus on Ruby and Rails beginners with a meeting on testing fundamentals. The Ruby and Rails communities strongly value automated testing and test-driven development, so much so that automated tests are a given for almost any Ruby project. But the whole area of testing is sometimes unfamiliar territory for someone new to Ruby or Rails. (We know this topic is of interest because it was specifically requested.)</p>
<p>As an introduction to testing, we'll work through an example of adding a feature to a Rails application using a test-first approach. Along the way we'll cover</p>
<ul>
  <li>Acceptance and integration tests (Cucumber)</li>
  <li>Unit tests for models, controllers, and routing (RSpec)</li>
  <li>Creating test data with factories (Factory Girl)</li>
  <li>Test doubles including stubs &amp; mocks (RSpec)</li>
</ul>
<p>To add interest for folks who are already familiar with some or all of the above, we'll do the whole thing using Rails 3.1.</p>
<p>Whether you're a complete beginner, an experienced developer new to Ruby, or a seasoned Rubyist, please join us for this meeting. Our goal is to encourage discussion and sharing of ideas from developers of all levels.</p>
