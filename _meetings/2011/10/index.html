<h3>Topic</h3>
<h4>Using the state_machine gem</h4>
<p>A finite-state machine or "state machine" is a common behavioral model used in computer programming. In a nutshell, a state machine can be in one of a finite number of states. An event or condition can then trigger a transition to another (or the same) state, and various actions can occur during a transition. (See <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite-state_machine" rel="external">Finite-state machine</a> for more.)</p>
