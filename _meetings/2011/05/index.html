<h4>Setting Up a Rails Development Environment without Giving Steve Jobs Money</h4>
<p>Ask almost any Rails developer what their biggest challenge in getting started with Rails was and chances are they will all roll their eyes and say the same thing: Setting up their development environment.</p>
<p>Although there are many options when it comes to Rails development environments, we will talk about setting up an Ubuntu-based development environment. Specifically a dual booted machine running Windows 7 as its existing OS.</p>
<p>The following topics will be covered:</p>
<ul>
  <li>How / Where to get Ubuntu - Creating the install USB drive (Yes, we will use 11.4)</li>
  <li>Installing Ubuntu as a secondary OS</li>
  <li>Install &amp; Configure RVM</li>
  <li>Install RubyMine</li>
  <li>Pull down a project from GitHub</li>
  <li>Using RubyMine and Bundler to manage Gems</li>
  <li>Run the project locally</li>
  <li>Create a new Heroku project and deploy to it</li>
</ul>
<p>This topic will primarily appeal to beginning Rubyists or developers thinking about getting started with Rails. A lot of technologies will be covered at a high level, so come with questions. Also, bring a buddy. If you've talked about Ruby or Rails with someone who's interested in the language / framework, but are too intimidated to jump in blind, bring them along.</p>
