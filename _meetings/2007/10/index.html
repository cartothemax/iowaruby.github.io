<h3>Topic</h3>
<h4>Real Applications in Ruby on Rails: An Introduction</h4>
<p>Ruby on Rails (RoR) is web application framework written in Ruby that 
  implements a Model-View-Controller architecture for database-backed web 
  sites.  There are plenty of tutorials available on the web which will guide 
  you through building a simple web application with Ruby on Rails.  With this 
  talk we hope to take that one step further by showing an RoR application in 
  the real world.</p>
<div id="extended">
  <p>We'll cover:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Directory structure for RoR</li>
    <li>What's a controller and do you need one for each model?</li>
    <li>How can you make your views reusable across controllers</li>
    <li>How do you manage the application with sub directories</li>
    <li>How do URLs map to controllers</li>
    <li>What's the routes.rb file and what can you do with it</li>
  </ul>
  <p>This talk will take take you neck deep into a real-world RoR application to 
    explore all of this.</p>
