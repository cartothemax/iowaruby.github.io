<h3>Speakers</h3>
<h4>Luke Amdor / <a href="http://www.studentloan.org/" rel="external">Iowa Student Loan</a></h4>
<h4>Ryan Hanks</h4>
<h3>Topic</h3>
<h4>Git</h4>
<p>Are you ready for an actual version control system that actually stays out of the way?  A system that doesn't take umpteen million commands just to work on a branch?  Something that doesn't force its workflow on you.  Welcome to the world of Git.  Git (<a href="http://git.or.cz/" rel="external">http://git.or.cz/</a>) is a distributed version control system focused on speed, effectivity and real-world usability.  Git was born out of the need for a non-linear distributed workflow for Linux kernel development.  Linus Torvald's design criteria were easy: "Take CVS as an example of what not to do.  If in doubt, do the opposite."</p>
<div id="extended">
  <p>Make sure to bring your laptops as we'll be doing some very hands on activities with Git.</p>
  <p>Due to the amount of time that we have, if you are bringing your own laptop and wish to follow our examples, could you please install Git via:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>On Windows: Through the installer on <a href="http://code.google.com/p/msysgit" rel="external">http://code.google.com/p/msysgit/</a></li>
    <li>On Max OS X: Through the installer on <a href="http://code.google.com/p/git-osx-installer/" rel="external">http://code.google.com/p/git-osx-installer/</a></li>
    <li>Everything else: Through your own package manager.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>It would be most helpful if you do this.  Thanks.</p>
  <p>Topics we'll touch on:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>What it means to be a distributed version control system?</li>
    <li>Git vs. SVN/CVS</li>
    <li>Git Commands</li>
