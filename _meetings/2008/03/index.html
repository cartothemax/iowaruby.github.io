<h1>March 2008</h1>
<h4>Thursday, March 27, 2008<span style="vertical-align:super">*</span></h4>
<p>6:00 - 7:30 PM</p>
<h3>Speaker</h3>
<h4>Luke Amdor / <a href="http://www.studentloan.org/" rel="external">Iowa Student Loan</a></h4>
<h3>Topic</h3>
<h4>Alternative Ruby (JRuby / Rubinius / IronRuby)</h4>
<p><span style="vertical-align:super">*</span><b>Note:</b>  This is a special meeting date.  We will return to our normal third Thursday meeting date in April.</p>
<p>Lately there has been a plethora of news surrounding alternative Ruby interpreters: Sun hires the main JRuby developers, Oracle begins deploying JRuby on Rails applications, Engine Yard hires Rubinius developers to work full time on Rubinius, and Microsoft is currently developing it's own Ruby interpreter IronRuby to run on its CLR.</p>
<p>In this presentation, we'll talk about the motivation behind these interpreters, where they're headed, and what impact this is having on the Ruby community.</p>
<div id="extended">
  <p>As far as practical examples go, we'll be showing an emphasis on JRuby and JRuby on Rails.  We'll show how to distribute Ruby scripts with only Java being installed on the platform, how to deploy an existing Ruby on Rails application into Sun's Glassfish, a JavaEE application server, how to create a quick and dirty Swing app using Ruby.</p>
  <p>Topics:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Motivation / Extending Ruby's Reach</li>
    <li>Sucking the information out of Matz's brain / Specs</li>
    <li>Rubinius</li>
    <li>Eating your own dog food / Ruby in Ruby</li>
    <li>JRuby / Introducing Ruby to the enterprise</li>
