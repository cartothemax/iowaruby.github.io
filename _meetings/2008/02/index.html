<h4>What's New in Rails 2.0?</h4>
<p>Ryan and David will cover the significant new features and changes from <a href="http://www.rubyonrails.org/" rel="external">Ruby on Rails 2.0</a>, which was released in December 2007 after almost a year of development.  We'll basically follow the outline in the <a href="http://weblog.rubyonrails.org/2007/12/7/rails-2-0-it-s-done" rel="external">announcement post</a>, and we'll provide code examples and live demos illustrating the major changes.  We'll also discuss effective migration strategies for Rails applications developed under previous versions of Rails.</p>
