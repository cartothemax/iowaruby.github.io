<h1>October 2008</h1>
<h4>Thursday, October 9, 2008</h4>
<p>6:00 - 7:30 PM</p>
<h3>Speaker</h3>
<h4><a href="http://blog.blainebuxton.com" rel="external">Blaine Buxton</a></h4>
<h3>Topic</h3>
<h4>Advanced Ruby</h4>
<p>Ruby is a wondrous language that can do more than just simply power Rails.  In this talk, Blaine Buxton will show off his <a href="http://rubyforge.org/projects/lazyenum/" rel="external">Lazy Enumeration</a> project, which while not a large project shows off a lot of Ruby's most advanced features.  Lazy Enumeration was implemented when Blaine read a paper on Higher Order Methods and wanted to play around with the idea.  Along the way, the idea was expanded to lazily build collections as well (they calculate collect, select, etc only when necessary).  Be prepared to see excellent use of polymorphism and functional programming.  Blaine will show how you too can push your Ruby code to greater heights.  Bring your thinking caps and curiosity.</p>
<p>Blaine leads the <a href="http://odynug.blainebuxton.com/" rel="external">Omaha Dynamic Language User Group</a>.</p>
