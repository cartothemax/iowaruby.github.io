Never want to install Ruby, PostgreSQL, or your favorite tool again? <a href="https://www.docker.io/" rel="external">Docker</a> is for you. Come learn how modern Linux containerization can speed your application deployment and development.</p>
<p>You will learn about what Docker is, how to use it for local development and how to move your code and infrastructure to a production environment. The last half of the presentation will be discussion format with time to talk through how to get your environment up and running on Docker containers.</p>
