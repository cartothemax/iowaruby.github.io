<h3>Topic</h3>
<h4>Git Demystified</h4>
<h3>Speaker</h3>

<p>Nearly every software developer has at least some familiarity
  with Git, the popular open source, distributed version control
  system.</p>
<p>To the uninitiated, Git can appear to be a large, dauntingly
  complex piece of software that might take years to understand. It
  turns out, though, that Git is actually much simpler than it
  first appears.</p>
<p>Everything in a Git repository is based on just three fundamental
  types of objects: blobs, trees, and commits. Once you understand
  what these are and how they relate to each other, the apparent
  complexity of Git melts away revealing a simple, elegant system
  that derives its power from its very simplicity.</p>
<p>In this talk, we'll look under the covers of Git to see what is
  actually in a git repository and what happens when you type `git
  commit.` You'll come away with a better understanding of how Git
  really works and greater confidence in using Git.</p>
