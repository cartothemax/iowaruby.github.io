<h1>July 2014</h1>
<h4>July 15, 2014</h4>
<p>6:00 - 7:30 PM</p>
<h3>Topic</h3>
<h4>Haskell or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Type Checker</h4>
<h3>Speaker</h3>
<h4>Chad Brewbaker</h4>
<p>Wouldn't it be great if our code was correct first time it compiled? Do you wish you had a big tool chest of higher order functions like Ruby's Array.map and Array.select?</p>
<p>Haskell, like Ruby, is written to optimize developer productivity. Unlike Ruby, it has a learning curve of getting used to a strong type checker.  This talk is intended to bootstrap you with all the resources you need to learn basic Haskell, and reuse Haskell concepts to write cleaner Ruby applications.</p>
<p>For those who want to bring a laptop Brian Allen has a guide on how to set up a basic Haskell development environment <a href="https://github.com/bitemyapp/learnhaskell" rel="external">https://github.com/bitemyapp/learnhaskell</a></p>
<p>Goals:</p>
<ol>
  <li>You will have written and debugged a small Haskell program to get a feel for the type checker.</li>
  <li>You will be aware of others in central Iowa who want to learn Haskell with you.</li>
  <li>You will understand how a strong type checker eliminates entire classes of bugs.</li>
  <li>You will learn at least one Haskell abstraction, the monoid, for scalable computing on large data streams.</li>
</ol>
