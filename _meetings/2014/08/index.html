<p>Tools for writing and testing your web software have never been better or easier to use.</p>
<p>The same is true for deploying and scaling that software on the internet.</p>
<p>Still, the choices can be confusing - should I stand up a Linode? Use EC2? What’s an AMI? Digital Ocean? Rackspace? An old Dell in my basement wired to the DSL? Can I roll-my-own CI with Jenkins? How?</p>
<p>At Merchants Bonding, we have turned to Travis CI and Heroku to help us deliver quality software quickly. We’ve learned and accomplished a lot in the past several months.</p>
<p>At this meeting we’ll look at how to deploy a Rails application straight to Heroku, and then iterate on that by adding Travis CI for automated testing and deployment after the tests pass.</p>
