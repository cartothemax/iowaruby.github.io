<h1>January 2014</h1>
<h4>January 21, 2014</h4>
<p>6:00 - 7:30 PM</p>
<h3>Speaker</h3>

<h3>Topic</h3>
<h4>A Gentle Introduction to AngularJS</h4>
<p>We'll take a look at the basic features of <a href="http://angularjs.org/" rel="external">AngularJS</a>, a framework from Google for building dynamic web applications.</p>
<p>The core feature of AngularJS, as well as many other similar frameworks is two-way data binding. Two-way data binding automatically updates the DOM when your model changes, and automatically updates your model when the DOM changes (for example, when a user enters data in an input field). As we'll see, it's straightforward to use AngularJS's two-way data binding by itself, and this feature alone might be enough to justify using a framework such as AngularJS even for relatively simple applications.</p>
<p>We'll also look at AngularJS's form support, as well as XHR and dependency injection.</p>
<p>If time permits, we'll examine a few other AngularJS features such as filters, event handlers, animations, and directives.</p>
<p>All of this will be in the context of a simple real-world application that was initially implemented in <a href="http://emberjs.com/" rel="external">Ember</a> and then ported to AngularJS for reasons that we'll discuss at the meeting.</p>
