<h1>December 2014</h1>
<h4>December 16, 2014</h4>
<p>6:00 - 7:30 PM</p>
<h3>Topic</h3>
<h4>Minitest</h4>
<h3>Speaker</h3>
<h4>David W. Body / <a href="http://www.bigcreek.com/" rel="external">Big Creek Software, LLC</a></h4>
<p>Minitest is a simple, fast, extensible test framework that is
  included in the Ruby standard library. It's perfect for small
  projects where something like RSpec might be overkill, but it's
  also used on projects as large as Ruby on Rails.</p>
<p>We'll take a look at how easy it is to use Minitest. We'll also
  look at some features of Minitest that you might not have known
  about, including</p>
<ul>
  <li>Optional RSpec-like DSL and matchers</li>
  <li>Test double support (stubs and mocks)</li>
  <li>Benchmarking support</li>
</ul>
<p>David W. Body is an independent software developer and President
  of <a href="http://www.bigcreek.com/" rel="external">Big Creek Software, LLC</a>.
  This will be his last meeting as organizer of the Iowa Ruby Brigade. Follow him on Twitter at
