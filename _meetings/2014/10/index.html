<h1>October 2014</h1>
<h4>October 21, 2014</h4>
<p>6:00 - 7:30 PM</p>
<h3>Topics &amp; Speakers</h3>
<p>This month we'll have two shorter topics (one for Ruby newbies and one
  slightly more advanced) that are somewhat related and should help us
  focus on thinking functionally.</p>
<h4>Enumerable Module</h4>
<h4>Dan Buettner / <a href="http://www.merchantsbonding.com/" rel="external">Merchants Bonding Company</a></h4>
<p>First, <a href="https://twitter.com/Capncavedan" rel="external">Dan Buettner</a> will introduce the <a href="http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.1.3/Enumerable.html" rel="external">Enumerable</a> module which
  includes handy methods like each, map, reduce, count, min, max, any?,
  all?, and so on. We'll see how easy it is to leverage Enumerable to
  unlock the power of Ruby.</p>
<h4>Transducers</h4>
<h4>David W. Body / <a href="http://www.bigcreek.com/" rel="external">Big Creek Software, LLC</a></h4>
<p>Second, <a href="https://twitter.com/david_body" rel="external">David W. Body</a> will cover <a href="http://cognitect-labs.github.io/" rel="external">Transducers</a>, which are "composable
  algorithmic transformations." This is a relatively new programming
  construct that is being introduced in the forthcoming Clojure 1.7 but
  has already been ported to several other languages including Ruby.
  We'll try to understand what problem transducers are meant to solve
  and discuss whether we think they are useful in Ruby.</p>
