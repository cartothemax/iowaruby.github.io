<p>Topics to be discussed may include some or all of the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Reading error messages and stack traces</li>
  <li>Using puts or logging statements</li>
  <li>Experimentation / hypothesis testing</li>
  <li>Unit tests &amp; integration tests as debugging aids</li>
  <li>Using source code revision history</li>
  <li>Effective use of search engines</li>
  <li>Ruby debuggers</li>
  <li>What to do when a bug appears in production but not development or test environments</li>
</ul>
<p>There will be plenty of time for questions and discussion.</p>
<p>Please join us no matter what your level of Ruby expertise might be!</p>
