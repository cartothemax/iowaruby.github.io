<h1>June 2014</h1>
<h4>June 17, 2014</h4>
<p>6:00 - 7:30 PM</p>
<h3>Topic</h3>
<h4>Docker Workshop</h4>
<h3>Speakers</h3>
<h4>Spencer Herzberg and David W. Body</h4>
<p>We will do a workshop style introduction to <a href="https://www.docker.io/" rel="external">Docker</a> using <a href="http://www.rackspace.com/" rel="external">Rackspace</a> virtual machines in the cloud. We will cover the basic docker commands. We will show you a few commands and have you work through some simple docker commands on your own in a teacher-student style format.</p>
<p>Things we will cover are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Running, stopping, inspecting containers</li>
  <li>Building your own container from scratch with Dockerfiles</li>
  <li>Building a basic Docker based architecture</li>
  <li>Building and running a Ruby based webapp container</li>
  <li>Building and running a Ruby background worker container (resque)</li>
</ul>
<p>This workshop will be fully hands-on and the only requirements are that you bring a computer with a ssh client (putty, cygwin, *nix shell) or pair up with someone else. Basic Linux knowledge will be helpful.</p>
<p>The workshop will be lead by Spencer Herzberg and David W. Body.</p>
<p>Spencer is half devops, half developer who is passionate about agile development and automation. He works for <a href="http://www.sourceallies.com/" rel="external">Source Allies</a> in Des Moines where he works on a wide variety of languages, frameworks and infrastructure.</p>
