<h1>May 2014</h1>
<h4>May 20, 2014</h4>
<p>6:00 - 7:30 PM</p>
<h3>Topic</h3>
<h4>RSpec (including RSpec 3)</h4>
<p>Testing and TDD have been hot topics since DHH's <a href="http://confreaks.com/videos/3315-railsconf-keynote-writing-software" rel="external">RailsConf 2014 Keynote</a> <a href="http://david.heinemeierhansson.com/2014/tdd-is-dead-long-live-testing.html" rel="external">and</a> <a href="http://blog.8thlight.com/uncle-bob/2014/05/02/ProfessionalismAndTDD.html" rel="external">the</a> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/notes/kent-beck/rip-tdd/750840194948847" rel="external">discussion</a> <a href="https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/blog/2014/tdd-straw-men-and-rhetoric" rel="external">it</a> <a href="https://plus.google.com/events/ci2g23mk0lh9too9bgbp3rbut0k" rel="external">continues</a> <a href="http://david.heinemeierhansson.com/2014/test-induced-design-damage.html" rel="external">to</a> <a href="http://codon.com/the-dhh-problem" rel="external">provoke</a>. (That's just a small sampling.)</p>
<p>Rather than simply rehash the ongoing "Is TDD Dead?" debate, we'll talk about Ruby testing and TDD in the context of the popular <a href="https://www.relishapp.com/rspec" rel="external">RSpec</a> test framework.</p>
<p>Topics to be discussed may include some or all of the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Getting started with RSpec</li>
  <li>Example groups</li>
  <li>Hooks (before, after, around)</li>
  <li>Helper methods</li>
  <li>Pending &amp; skipped examples</li>
  <li>RSpec expectations and built-in matchers</li>
  <li>Test doubles (stubs, mocks, etc.)</li>
  <li>What's new in RSpec 3?</li>
</ul>
<p>There will be time for questions and discussion, and we may touch on some of the issues raised in the ongoing TDD debate.</p>
<p>We may also look at some atypical uses of RSpec in a real-world application currently under development.</p>
<p>Please join us. There should be something for everyone regardless of your Ruby experience level.</p>
