<h1>April 2010</h1>
<h4>April 8, 2010</h4>
<p>6:00 - 7:30 PM</p>
<h3>Speaker</h3>
<h4>Matt Secoske / <a href="http://nimblelogic.com/" rel="external">nimblelogic</a></h4>
<h3>Topic</h3>
<h4>The Lightweight web: singing Sinatra to the tune of Redis</h4>
<p>We will dive into the Sinatra web framework, along with a detour through Redis in an attempt to show just how lightweight a Ruby web service can be.  This will be an informal overview and discussion, with an aside to cover the reasons why you should consider Sinatra for your next web service project.</p>
<p>We will also probably spend some time looking at "Evented" Sinatra and Resque, the Redis + Sinatra queuing framework from the fancy chaps at Github.</p>
<p>A little about Matt Secoske:</p>
