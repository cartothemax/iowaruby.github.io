<h1>August 2010</h1>
<h4>August 12, 2010</h4>
<p>6:00 - 7:30 PM</p>
<h3>Topic</h3>
<h4>Ruby Version Manager (RVM)</h4>
<p><a href="http://rvm.beginrescueend.com/" rel="external">RVM</a> is a command-line tool that lets you install and manage multiple versions of Ruby on the same computer in such a way that they won't interfere with each other. You can even run different versions of Ruby at the same time in different terminal windows.</p>
<p>RVM makes testing against multiple versions of Ruby quite easy. For example, you can invoke a single command that will run your tests under, say, Ruby 1.8.7, 1.9.1, 1.9.2, JRuby, Rubinius, and Ruby Enterprise Edition.</p>
<p>RVM also provides a way to create and manage separate groups of Ruby gems (gemsets). For example, you can have separate gemsets for Rails 2.3.8 and Rails 3.0.0.rc and easily switch between them. It can also be useful to maintain per-project gemsets.</p>
<p>We will cover the following RVM topics:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Installing RVM</li>
  <li>Installing multiple Rubies and switching between them</li>
  <li>Testing with RVM</li>
  <li>Gemsets</li>
  <li>Integration with other tools (e.g. TextMate, Capistrano, Passenger, etc.)</li>
</ul>
<p>RVM is free and open source, and runs on Mac OS X and most versions of Linux.</p>
<p>Note: There is a similar tool for Windows called <a href="http://github.com/vertiginous/pik/" rel="external">pik.</a> It would be great if someone at the meeting wants to give us more information about this.</p>
