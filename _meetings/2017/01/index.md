### Topic

#### An Introduction to the Elixir Programming Language

A common piece of advice shared amongst developers and programmers is to learn one new programming language a year.  Learning new programming languages help programmers to understand different solutions to problems and expose them to new language paradigms.

Elixir is a dynamic, functional language that was born out of the pain points of doing concurrency programming with Ruby while also addressing issues of scalability and speed that have plagued Ruby.

While Ruby is firmly rooted in the Object Oriented world it does have make use of functional programming paradigms.  Elixir is a great language of choice for Rubyists to explore and push their understanding of functional programming.  This meeting will give an introduction to what Elixir has to offer and demonstrate why it is a great tool for Ruby developers to work with.
