### Topic

#### Service Objects: Finding the Right Tool For the Job

Everyone recommends using service objects in Rails applications, but how? How should they be setup? Should they be built from scratch or using a library? How should they be called? What should they return? I’ll take you through a tour of several ways to implement a service layer. Hopefully by the end you’ll be able to make a decision about how to implement service objects in a way that makes sense for your projects.
