# March 2017

#### March 21, 2017
11:30 - 1:00 PM

### Topic

#### Don't forget about your database (Redux)

When programming (especially in RoR and Wordpress) most developers have a set it and leave it
mentality to their databases. Until it screeches to a screaming halt, or god forbid you've used
all your connections and locked all your users out. So to help minimize those moments, I will go
over simple things to help you understand your database, make it run more efficiently and help
it stay up and running. For example:

1. Understanding and Creating table indexes... the right way
1. Using built in views to get a sense of how your databases and indexes are working
1. The different between Views and Functions/Stored Procedures and how when when to use them.
1. When using all the above, reorganize large tables and update your database statistics for better query optimization.  (PSQL ANALYZE, MYSQL OPTIMIZE)
1. Database Config files and some simple basic settings you can do when starting a project.
1. Also if time, when things go wrong, helpful tools/software that come in handy to help figure out what's going on.

Let's get crazy, and learn about some db's!!!
