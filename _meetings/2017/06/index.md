# June 2017

#### MONDAY, June 19, 2017
11:30 - 1:00 PM

### Topic

#### What's new in Rails 5.1

Rails 5.1 has been out for over a month now. In this talk, we will look at whatâ€™s new in this latest release of Rails. This includes:

* Yarn
* Webpack
* Parameterized Mailers
* Direct / Resolved Routes
* System tests
* Encrypted secrets
* Unification of form_for and form_tag into form_with

In addition to the big features, we will take a look at some of the smaller API changes and deprecations that were introduced. Rather than simply reading from the changelog, I will provide examples of how and why you might want to use the various features. Finally, we will discuss any pain points we ran into during the upgrade process.
