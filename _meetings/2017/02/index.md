# February 2017

#### February 21, 2017
11:30 - 1:00 PM

### Topic

#### Docker by Example

Starting from a fresh Rails app, I'll explain why you might want to use Docker and show how you can take advantage of it. I'll go through setting up an example application in a Docker container and iterate on the example in an attempt to achieve a production ready state. I will also cover splitting responsibilities through Docker Compose and integrating Docker with your build system.

He will be survived by his wife Courtney and a plethora of cats. Until then you can find him on [twitter @punk1290](https://twitter.com/punk1290)
