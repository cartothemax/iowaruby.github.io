<h3>Topic</h3>
<h4>Writing Internal CLI Tools using Ruby and Thor</h4>
<p>At Banno, we have built up an internal tool called banno-utility-belt or bub for short. This tool allows all developers and ops to have a singular go-to tool for many of our commonly done tasks. Using Thor and Ruby has allowed us to have a extendable and self-documenting command line interface.</p>
<p>In this presentation, you'll learn how to leverage Ruby and Thor to codify processes and practices for the betterment of your internal ecosystem.</p>
