<h1>January 2013</h1>
<h4>January 15, 2013</h4>
<p>6:00 - 7:30 PM</p>
<h3>Topic</h3>
<h4>Code Kata: Roman Numerals</h4>
<p>At our last meeting we talked about doing some hands-on coding sessions in 2013. We're going to kick off the new year with the classic Roman Numerals code kata.</p>
<p>What a code kata? According to Wikipedia, a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kata_%28programming%29" rel="external">code kata</a> is an exercise in programming which helps a programmer hone their skills through practice and repetition.</p>
<p>Bring your computer or plan to pair up with someone else. We'll be working on test-driving code to convert decimal numbers to Roman Numerals. For example, 2013 is MMXIII. More details on the kata are available <a href="http://codingdojo.org/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?KataRomanNumerals" rel="external">here</a>.</p>
<p>This is a relatively easy kata which many people should be able to complete during the meeting. Of course, there are many ways to solve it and you may want to experiment with alternative solutions.</p>
<p>You're welcome to work in any language(s) you want, but Ruby is a good fit for this kata.</p>
