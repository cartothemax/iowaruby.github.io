<h3>Topic</h3>
<h4>Literate Functional Exploration with Cucumber and WATIR</h4>
<p>The first part will be a talk going over the basics of Cucumber and WATIR, demonstrating how we can write literate functional tests and data extractors using the human friendly Gherkin DSL, Ruby regular expressions, and the page object model for organization.</p>
<p>The second half will consist of breaking off into small groups for a brief code kata to implement a simple web scraper.</p>

<p>UPDATE: You can participate in the kata using nothing more than a modern web browser if you sign up for a free <a href="https://www.nitrous.io/" rel="external">nitrous.io</a> account. Otherwise bring git and your favorite Ruby.</p>
