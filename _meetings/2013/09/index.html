<h1>September 2013</h1>
<h4>September 17, 2013</h4>
<p>6:00 - 7:30 PM</p>
<h3>Topic</h3>
<h4>Getting Started with Ruby</h4>
<p>This month we're going back to basics with an introductory level
  discussion on getting started with Ruby. We'll discuss
  the proper way to set up an environment for Ruby programming, including</p>
<ul>
  <li>Installing Ruby (including ways not to do it)</li>
  <li>Installing and managing Ruby gems</li>
  <li>Using tools like Bundler and Rake</li>
  <li>Other elements of a good Ruby development environment</li>
</ul>
<p>We'll assume the typical attendee is a programmer with experience
  in at least one other language but little to no experience with Ruby.
  Nevertheless, everyone from complete beginners through experienced 
  Rubyists is invited to attend and might learn something.</p>
