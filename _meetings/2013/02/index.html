<h1>February 2013</h1>
<h4>February 19, 2013</h4>
<p>6:00 - 7:30 PM</p>
<h3>Speaker</h3>
<h4>Toran Billups / <a href="http://www.imtins.com/" rel="external">The IMT Group</a></h4>
<h3>Topic</h3>
<h4>Ember.js</h4>
<p>With all the hype around javascript these days it's hard to know what library or framework will help you deliver more features with less code.</p>
<p>If you are interested in learning more about a full featured framework that provides an application programming model similar to the server side MVC frameworks you already know and love, maybe <a href="http://emberjs.com/" rel="external">ember.js</a> is for you.</p>
<p>Join me for a discussion about why I decided it was time to use a real framework on the client side and how it changed the way I write javascript today.</p>
<p>Some knowledge of javascript is recommended but not required.</p>
<p>Toran Billups is a Python and JavaScript enthusiast with hopes of knowing enough about ember.js and django to build a modern web app.</p>
