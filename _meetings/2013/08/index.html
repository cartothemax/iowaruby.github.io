<h1>August 2013</h1>
<h4>August 20, 2013</h4>
<p>6:00 - 7:30 PM</p>
<h3>Joint meeting with <a href="http://dsmjs.com/" rel="external">dsmJS</a></h3>
<h4>Intro Topic * why single page apps anyway?</h4>
<p>Ever wonder what all the hype around single page apps is about? Join us for a beginner friendly discussion about what makes building a single page app different from traditional web development and why you would choose one over the other.</p>
<h4>Advanced Topic * a gentle introduction to ember.js</h4>
<p>As the ember.js javascript framework matures to 1.0 what does the “hello world” experience look like today? What does each component in the framework do and what are the naming conventions required to wire them up? What is the story behind the new router api and how do you work with nested routes/controllers? What is the persistence story?</p>
