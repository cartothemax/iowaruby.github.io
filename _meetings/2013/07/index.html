<h3>Topic</h3>
<h4>Chef 101</h4>
<p>Chef is a configuration management platform written in Ruby. With Chef you can build up a server from a base image to its desired production ready state. Chef allows you to express the state of your infrastructure as code, which can be reviewed, tested, and version controlled. This allows for changes in said infrastructure to be applied with much lower risk. The nature of Chef allows engineers to bring up parts or the whole infrastructure with tools like Vagrant. Unit testing with chefspec and integration testing with test-kitchen are new developments in the Chef Community.</p>
<p>This talk to will cover the following tools:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Chef</li>
  <li>Knife</li>
  <li>Berkshelf</li>
  <li>Vagrant</li>
  <li>Chefspec</li>
