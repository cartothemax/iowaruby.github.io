<h1>November 2013</h1>
<h4>November 19, 2013</h4>
<p>6:00 - 7:30 PM</p>
<h3>Speaker</h3>
<h4>David W. Body / <a href="http://www.bigcreek.com/" rel="external">Big Creek Software, LLC</a></h4>
<h3>Topic</h3>
<h4>Crypto 101</h4>
<p>We all use cryptography every day. Whether it's HTTP Secure (HTTPS) in a web browser for email, e-commerce, or online banking, or deploying a Rails application via SCP/SSH, most of us never give a second thought to how this actually works. As software developers and system administrators, we often deal with public keys, digital certificates, and the like, but how many of us really understand the underlying principles?</p>
<p>We'll talk about basic cryptographic concepts that everyone should be familiar with. Topics will include</p>
<ul>
  <li>Symmetric encryption</li>
  <li>Public key encryption</li>
  <li>Secure hash functions</li>
  <li>Digital signatures</li>
  <li>Digital certificates</li>
</ul>
<p>We'll follow a practical approach, covering just enough theory to understand the basic concepts involved. Whether you're completely new to this subject or just need a refresher, you'll leave this talk with a solid understanding of the cryptographic principles that underlie technologies you use every day.</p>
<h3>Door Prize</h3>
<p>We'll be giving away two copies of the excellent <em><a href="https://leanpub.com/fp-oo" rel="external">Functional Programming for the Object-Oriented Programmer</a></em> by <a href="https://twitter.com/marick" rel="external">Brian Marick</a>. Thanks Brian!</p>
