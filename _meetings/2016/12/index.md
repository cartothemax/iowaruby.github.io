# December 2016

#### December 20, 2016
11:30 AM - 1:00 PM

### Topic

#### Separating persistence from logic

There's been some chatter the last couple of years about how bad databases are, and how persistence is the root of all
evil. Some speakers make light of it, talking about pooping things into the database. Yet that pesky database is where
we keep the data entrusted to us by our users (a.k.a. paying customers). Oops!

How can we make sure that part of our software still works, spend more time focusing on the business logic that
differentiates what we're really doing, and not lose our minds in the process?

We'll explore using an ActiveRecord model to store our data, and a separate Plain Old Ruby Object to handle the business
logic, instead of muddling them together.  We'll talk about what advantages this brings and what tradeoffs we make along
the way.

We'll be looking at code and running tests, so bring your reading glasses!
