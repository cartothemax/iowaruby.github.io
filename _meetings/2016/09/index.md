# September 2016

#### September 16, 2016
11:30 AM - 1:00 PM

### Topic

#### RubyMine

RubyMine is a fully featured IDE with first-class support for Ruby and Rails, JavaScript and CoffeeScript, ERB and HAML, CSS, Sass and Less, and more. It allows you to produce high-quality code more efficiently by taking taking advantage of language specific-aware syntax & error highlighting, code formatting, code completion, and quick documentation.

In this talk, we will be taking an in-depth look into some of the features and advantages of using RubyMine as your primary editor. As with any development tool, RubyMine has some shortcomings. This talk will address some of these issues and will offer some tips and remedies to the more common ones.

This talk will focus on discussion over presentation. You are encouraged to bring your opinions and discussion points regarding your tool of choice.
