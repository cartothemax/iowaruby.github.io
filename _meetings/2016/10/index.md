# October 2016

#### October 18, 2016
11:30 AM - 1:00 PM

### Topic

#### Debugging

Debugging is painful, but it can be less painful. What can you do to make debugging sessions less painful? What can you do to make the process quicker so you can move on to other things? In this talk, you will be presented a practical framework for solving any kind of bug that comes your way. Using this framework we will work through a few different kind of bugs, ranging from syntax bugs to logic bugs and we'll look at a variety of tools that can be used to debug your ruby programs. After this talk, you'll be first in line to volunteer for the next bug that rears its ugly head.
