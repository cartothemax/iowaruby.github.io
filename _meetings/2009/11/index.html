<h3>Topic</h3>
<h4>RubyGems - Past, Present, and Future</h4>
<p><a href="http://rubygems.org/" rel="external">RubyGems</a> is the standard for distributing and managing Ruby code packages. Beginning with Ruby 1.9, RubyGems is included with Ruby itself.</p>
<p>Everyone who has worked with with Ruby is probably already familiar with using RubyGems to download and install Ruby libraries written by others. Gems exist for many tasks, including, for example, manipulating images, validating credit cards, parsing HTML, and generating PDF's. Gems are also an excellent way of distributing your own code if you create a Ruby library you want to share with others.</p>
<p>In this talk, we will briefly discuss the history of RubyGems before focusing on the present and future of RubyGems. Specifically, we will discuss:</p>
<ul>
<li>Using RubyGems and managing your RubyGems environment</li>
<li>The transition to <a href="http://gemcutter.org/" rel="external">GemCutter</a> from <a href="http://rubyforge.org/" rel="external">RubyForge</a> and <a href="http://gems.github.com/" rel="external">Github</a></li>
<li>Creating and publishing your own gems using <a href="http://github.com/technicalpickles/jeweler/" rel="external">Jeweler</a></li>
<li><a href="http://github.com/wycats/bundler/" rel="external">Bundler</a> (a gem to bundle gems)</li>
</ul>
<p>There will be plenty of time for discussion, so bring your RubyGems questions and ideas.</p>
