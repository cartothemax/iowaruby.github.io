<h1>June 2009</h1>
<h4>June 11, 2009</h4>
<p>6:00 - 7:30 PM</p>
<h3>Speaker</h3>
<h4>David W. Body / <a href="http://www.bigcreek.com/" rel="external">Big Creek Software, LLC</a></h4>
<h3>Topic</h3>
<h4>Rack &amp; Metal</h4>
<p>One of the most significant changes in Rails 2.3 was Rack integration. Rack integration not only simplifies deployment, but it also
enables Rails Metal, which provides a simple way to add super-fast actions to a Rails application. Yet because these change are largely internal,
many Rails developers may not even be aware of Rack or Metal — even after upgrading to Rails 2.3.</p>
<p>But Rack isn't just for Rails. Other Ruby web frameworks also include Rack adapters, including Camping, Merb, Sinatra, and Ramaze, to name a few. Web servers providing Rack handlers include Mongrel, WEBrick, Thin, and Phusion Passenger, to name a few. In fact Phusion Passenger, which is often referred to as "mod_rails" could more aptly be named "mod_rack."</p>
<p><a href="http://rack.rubyforge.org/" rel="external">Rack</a> is a minimal API for connecting web servers with
Ruby web frameworks. How minimal? Here is a simple Rack application:</p>
<pre>
class HelloWorld
  def call(env)
    [200, {"Content-Type" =&gt; "text/plain"}, ["Hello world!"]]
  end
end
</pre>
<p>David will introduce Rack and explain briefly how it works. We will then look at how Rails and other frameworks use Rack, and how developers can
take advantage of Rack.</p>
<p>Topics that will be covered:</p>
<ul>
<li>Building and running a simple Rack application</li>
<li>Rack integration in Rails, including script/server and rake middleware</li>
<li>Rack middleware</li>
<li>Rails Metal</li>
<li>and more...</li>
</ul>
