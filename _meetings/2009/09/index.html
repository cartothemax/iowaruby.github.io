<h1>September 2009</h1>
<h4>September 10, 2009</h4>
<p>6:00 - 7:30 PM</p>
<h3>Speaker</h3>
<h4>Yehuda Katz / <a href="http://www.engineyard.com/" rel="external">Engine Yard</a></h4>
<h3>Topic</h3>
<h4>What's New in Rails 3?</h4>
<p>In honor of the Iowa Ruby Brigade's two-year anniversary, <a href="http://yehudakatz.com/" rel="external">Yehuda Katz</a> of 
<a href="http://www.engineyard.com/" rel="external">Engine Yard</a> will join us to talk about some of the new features in Rails 3,
and to answer questions and discuss topics of interest to the group.</p>
<p>Of course Rails 3 is the result of the <a href="http://weblog.rubyonrails.org/2008/12/23/merb-gets-merged-into-rails-3" rel="external">merger</a> 
of two Ruby web frameworks: <a href="http://www.rubyonrails.org/" rel="external">Ruby on Rails</a> and 
<a href="http://merbivore.com/" rel="external">Merb</a>. Yehuda was lead developer of Merb, and as a Rails core team member, Yehuda has played a central 
role in the development effort to merge the two frameworks. Yehuda will talk about that effort and preview some of the changes in Rails 3.</p>
<p>We'll also have plenty of time for questions and general discussion.</p>

<p>Yehuda Katz is currently employed by <a href="http://www.engineyard.com/" rel="external">Engine Yard</a>, and works full time as a Core Team Member on the Rails and Merb projects. He is the co-author of <a href="http://www.manning.com/affiliate/idevaffiliate.php?id=485_93" rel="external">jQuery in Action</a> and the upcoming <a href="http://www.manning.com/affiliate/idevaffiliate.php?id=485_145" rel="external">Rails 3 in Action</a>, and is a contributor to <a href="http://www.manning.com/affiliate/idevaffiliate.php?id=485_96" rel="external">Ruby in Practice</a>.</p>
<p>He spends most of his time hacking on Rails and Merb, but also on other Ruby community projects, like <a href="http://rubini.us/" rel="external">Rubinius</a> and <a href="http://datamapper.org/" rel="external">Datamapper</a>. And when the solution doesn't yet exist, he'll try his hand at creating one - as such, he's also created projects like <a href="http://github.com/wycats/thor/" rel="external">Thor</a> and <a href="http://github.com/sam/do" rel="external">DO.rb</a>.</p>
<p>Yehuda will join us via remote video conferencing.</p>
