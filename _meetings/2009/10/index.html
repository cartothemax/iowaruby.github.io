<h1>October 2009</h1>
<h4>October 8, 2009</h4>

<h3>Speaker</h3>

<h3>Topic</h3>
<h4>Searching ActiveRecord Models</h4>
<p>Search is one of the most common tasks performed by computer users, so
it's not surprising that a common application requirement is that data
within an application be searchable.  In a Rails application, or for
that matter any application that uses ActiveRecord, what are the best
ways to implement search functionality?</p>
<p>Darrin has set out to answer that question and he will share what he
has learned. This presentation will compare the following approaches
to searching ActiveRecord models:</p>
<ul>
<li>Plain Old SQL</li>
<li>Plugins/gems that wrap SQL</li>
<li>Sphinx/UltraSphinx</li>
</ul>
<p>There will be time for discussion, so bring your questions and
suggestions for alternative ways to implement search in an
ActiveRecord application.</p>
