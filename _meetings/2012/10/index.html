<h3>Topic</h3>
<h4>Full-Text Search Using Solr</h4>
<p>Search functions on the web are ubiquitous, but not all of them work well enough to actually be useful.  If you've wondered how to improve your own app's capabilities, come learn about Solr - a powerful, easy to use, and fast full-text search solution that easily plugs into a Rails application.</p>
<p>We'll talk about how to make your models searchable, boosting results based on where search terms appear, Solr configuration for synonyms, and constructing "advanced search" combinations of parameters.</p>
<p>If you're cobbling together your own full-text-like search routines against SQL databases in Rails by splitting search strings into tokens and then concatenating SQL snippets, you're working too hard.  (Go ahead, ask me how I know).</p>
<p>Dan Buettner is a web developer at <a href="http://www.merchantsbonding.com" rel="external">Merchants Bonding Company</a> in Des Moines and president of <a href="http://port80productions.com" rel="external">Port 80 Productions</a>. He excels at merge commits and writing SQL by hand.</p>
