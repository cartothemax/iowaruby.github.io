<h1>February 2012</h1>
<h4>February 21, 2012</h4>
<p>6:10 - 7:40 PM</p>
<h3>Speaker</h3>
<h4>Darrin Holst (<a href="https://twitter.com/#!/darrinholst" rel="external">@darrinholst</a>)</h4>
<h3>Topic</h3>
<h4>CoffeeScript</h4>
<p>From <a href="http://coffeescript.org/" rel="external">coffeescript.org</a>…</p>
<blockquote>The golden rule of CoffeeScript is: "It's just JavaScript". The code compiles one-to-one into the equivalent JS, and there is no interpretation at runtime.</blockquote>
<ul>
  <li>Why - If it's just JavaScript then why would I want to use it?</li>
  <li>What - Covering syntax and idioms.</li>
  <li>Where - I'll be discussing rails integration and how you'd use it outside of Rails.</li>
  <li>Warts - It's not all rainbows and ponies…I'll show some things that I don't like.</li>
  <li>Testing - not specific to CoffeeScript, but I'll show how I've been doing headless testing with Jasmine and PhantomJS.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that our meeting time has been moved back 10 minutes to make it easier for those who want to park on the street.</p>
