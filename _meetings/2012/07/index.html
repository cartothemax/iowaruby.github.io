<h3>Speaker</h3>

<h3>Topic</h3>
<h4>JavaScript Testing with Jasmine</h4>
<p>If you're like me, you've struggled with adding custom JavaScript functionality to your application because there wasn't a good way to test your code besides constantly reloading your browser page (and emptying your cache!).</p>
<p>Enter <a href="http://pivotal.github.com/jasmine/" rel="external">Jasmine</a>, an RSpec-like tool for automated testing of your JavaScript code.</p>
<p>We'll look at the basics of setting up Jasmine in a Rails project, its RSpec-like syntax, and talk about a couple of gotchas that are easy to work around ... provided that you know about them.</p>
<p>This talk will be great for JavaScript beginners, as that's really what I am - but the installation and setup of Jasmine should be useful for seasoned pros as well.</p>
