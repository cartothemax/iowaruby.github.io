<h1>June 2012</h1>
<h4>June 19, 2012</h4>
<p>6:00 - 7:30 PM</p>
<h3>Topic</h3>
<h4>Iowa Ruby Brigade Planning</h4>
<p>The Iowa Ruby Brigade has been around since September 2007. Over that time, we've seen members come, and we've seen members go. The goal of this meeting is to talk about the future of IRB, and what the members want from it going forward. In preparation for this planning meeting, we have put together a simple mission statement to help guide the conversation.</p>
<blockquote><i>The Iowa Ruby Brigade aims to grow and support a unified community of Rubyists with community education, technological innovation, and outreach.</i></blockquote>
<p>Starting with this meeting, our meeting location will change to Goodsmiths in West Des Moines. Goodsmiths will also sponsor pizza and liquid refreshments at the meeting.</p>
