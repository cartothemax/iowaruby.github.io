<h3>Topic</h3>
<h4>Concurrency for Humans</h4>
<p>The erstwhile Google Wave promised multi-user editing of documents for all. Wouldn't it be nice if it was a Ruby library and worked for arbitrary JSON documents? Tonight we'll explore a <a href="https://github.com/collin/share.rb" rel="external">port</a> of the excellent <a href="http://sharejs.org" rel="external">ShareJS</a> library for Ruby.</p>
<p>Collin Miller is both a native Iowan and a native Rubyist. While he isn't programming Collin enjoys performing improvised comedy on stage with his troupe, "The Beards".</p>
