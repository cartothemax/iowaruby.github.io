<h1>December 2012</h1>
<h4>December 18, 2012</h4>
<p>6:00 - 7:30 PM</p>
<h3>Speaker</h3>
<h4>Matt Morrison / <a href="http://www.imtins.com/" rel="external">The IMT Group</a></h4>
<h3>Topic</h3>
<h4>Rails Engines</h4>
<p>How Engines solve the problem that I've always had with Rails...</p>
<p>Rails is a great framework that I enjoy using. One big problem that I have with rails is how easy it makes it to build a monolithic monstrosity. <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/" rel="external">Django</a>, which I primarily use for my day job, has the same problem, but Django also takes steps to make functionality more compartmentalized than Rails does. I'm going to show an example of how I used Django's compartmentalization mechanism to my advantage in a production application and how Rails Engines can accomplish the same result.</p>
<p>Matthew J. Morrison is a software developer currently employed by <a href="http://www.imtins.com/" rel="external">IMT Group</a> where he builds web applications and services using Python. He is also the organizer of the Iowa Python Users Group (<a href="http://www.pyowa.org/" rel="external">pyowa.org</a>).</p>
