# Ruby on Rails Teacher/Trainer/Mentor

### Wanted: Ruby on Rails Teacher/Trainer/Mentor

Hi!  I am looking for a RoR expert to help me on an as-needed basis with learning Rails.  I have been using a variety of resources (books, web, etc.) to get me started, but as I try to build out my own ideas, it would be great to have someone to answer questions when I get stuck.  I am definitely a beginner.

I would anticipate that this person would help me anywhere from 5-50 hours per month.  I am willing and open to working with your schedule.  If you are crazy busy with other stuff and we can’t figure out a time, no worries at all.  I am willing to pay per hour.

I am located in West Des Moines.

If interested, please e-mail me at: [jkent2910@gmail.com](mailto:jkent2910@gmail.com).  Please provide any examples of work, and describe your experience with RoR either in the e-mail or by providing a resume.

Thanks!<br/>
  Julie
