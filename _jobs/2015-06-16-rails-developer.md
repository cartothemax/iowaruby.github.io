# Rails Developer

Business is smokin' and we're ready for another developer to join our team! We code primarily in Ruby on Rails, Objective C (iOS) and Android.

We do a lot of responsive web and use javascript, Bootstrap and whatever else has newly emerged by the time I finish this post pretty extensively. If that sounds like a bit much, don't worry, none of us knew all of those technologies when we started either, so we're happy to help you learn.

If we don't care about a long checklist of languages, what DO we care about?

* People. We are about creating awesomeness and you can't do that if you're burned out. We won't ask you to work crazy hours (40/week is the norm) and we want you to have a life. We also have Flex Fridays (a favorite amongst our team) so people can enjoy the weekend a little early, as well as work from home days.
* A passion for learning: technology advances every day, we can be the ones advancing it or be left behind.
* A passion for the best end result: our clients don't hire us to write code, they hire us to bring their visions to life (and sometimes, to help them see that vision for what it could be).
* A passion for making US better: we believe in investing in tools and processes to improve the way we do our jobs every day - that's what tech is all about.

We offer competitive salaries, a cafeteria plan (including health insurance, dental insurance, dependent care flex plan), a company-matched retirement plan, WFH time and Flex Fridays because happy, un-stressed people build the best technology.
