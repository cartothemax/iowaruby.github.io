# Software Developer

## DESCRIPTION

This isn't your typical developer job. We're looking for someone who loves to solve problems, create amazing things, and make a real impact with their work.

You will be an integral member of our development team building out new marketing and communication software people will love to use. Work with us to conceptualize new ways of looking at problems, add new features, and build software that has a positive impact on our products and company.

This position is not for the code-monkey type who is content toiling away in a cubicle somewhere. You will be working on dynamic projects that require you to think creatively and create software that meets real-world business objectives.

## REQUIREMENTS

You must be an experienced programmer. But this is not measured by number of years spent in an office. Nor do we care as much about how many languages you know (though we enjoy writing in Node.js and Ruby, and our favorite database is MySQL and use Redis and Mongo when needed). You should be knowledgeable in algorithm design, performance tuning, software design, debugging, documentation, and testing. Other requirements include:

- The ability to learn. Have experience with technology and willing to use the strengths of multiple technologies to solve real-world problems.

- Nimbleness to shift gears and juggle multiple projects and problems at any given time.

- Eagerness be a part of every aspect of running a business; you will build new software to help us run efficiently, improve our products, and help everyone better understand our technology.

- Positivity and enthusiasm. As a startup it's critical that you not only work well with a small team of professionals, but bring an upbeat and winning attitude.

## BENEFITS

This is a fantastic opportunity for someone to get in at the early stages of a promising startup. The right candidate will find it fulfilling to have a direct impact on the direction and success of our company.

We offer a competitive salary, opportunity for company units, casual dress, unlimited PTO, weekly provided collaborative lunches, and an extremely talented and lively team. Perks also include great coffee, access to top-of-the-line technology and software, and the freedoms a nimble startup grants.
