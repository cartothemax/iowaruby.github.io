## Full Stack Developer

#### DESCRIPTION

##### [Entrepreneurial Technologies](https://entretechno.com)

**We are looking for a web problem-solver who enjoys variety, daily learning, and making a difference.**

Clients come to us when they have a software need or idea and need help executing it. We jump in to: design a solution, code the project, and support that code long term. Those needs vary from consumer to business apps such as telemedicine and civil engineering reporting. Our clients’ demands keep growing, and we’re ready to add another strong web developer to our team. This role will primarily work on cloud-based software projects but may occasionally also work on mobile projects.

Previous Ruby experience is a plus but not required.

Perks of working here include:

* Competitive salary
* Paid time off
* Medical and dental insurance
* Retirement plan
* Casual environment
