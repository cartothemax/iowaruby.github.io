# Experienced Ruby Developer

About the Position:
Growth is a beautiful thing, and after more than doubling our business in the last two years, we're looking for the right person to help continue this growth.

This person's role will be focused on helping us develop the best Ruby projects possible for our clients and ourselves in a team-focused environment. Some iOS development is available but not required. What is required is a desire to keep improving, both in terms of code and in terms of the skills and processes we use to produce that end product. We are looking for at least 3 years of experience -- if you have more than that (or equivalent skills) it will be rewarded accordingly.

About ET:
We are a client-focused custom development firm specializing in larger, custom web and mobile solutions. We believe that happy people produce the best code and strive to make this the best environment possible by promoting work-life balance with a flexible time off policy and very little night/weekend work. Our cafeteria benefits plan includes medical insurance, dental insurance, a company retirement account match and a flexible spending account for dependent care expenses.

We're also planning an incentive trip to Mexico this winter - join now and sip margaritas with us on the beach!
